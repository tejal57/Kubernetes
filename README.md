# Kubernetes

### What is Kubernetes
Kubernetes is an open-source container management also known as container orchestration tool for automating software deployment, scaling, and management.

### Why Kubernetes?
Kubernetes offers several key advantages that make it a popular choice for container orchestration and management:

🧑🏻‍💻Deployment: Deploy a specified number of containers to a specified host and keep them running in a wanted state.

✏️Rollouts: A rollout is a change to a deployment. Kubernetes lets you initiate, pause, resume or roll back rollouts.

🌎Service discovery: Kubernetes can automatically expose a container to the internet or to other containers by using a domain name system (DNS) name or IP address.

🛢️provisioning: Set Kubernetes to mount persistent local or cloud storage for your containers as needed.

⚖️Load balancing: Based on CPU usage or custom metrics, Kubernetes load balancing can distribute the workload across the network to maintain performance and stability.

📈Autoscaling: When traffic spikes, Kubernetes autoscaling can spin up new clusters as needed to handle the additional workload.

🌐 Self-healing for high availability: When a container fails, Kubernetes can restart or replace it automatically to prevent downtime. It can also take down containers that don’t meet your health check requirements.




### What is Container Orchestration
Orchestration enables developers to easily build containerized applications and services, as well as scale, schedule and monitor those containers.

### Nodes
Nodes are physical or virtual machine in which kubernetes is installed.

### Cluster
Cluster is group of nodes, if one node fails we have our application accessible from other nodes.

### Master
Master is other node in which kubernetes is installed and it manages other nodes

### Components
  1.API Server

  2.etcd

  3.kubelet

  4.Container Runtime

  5.Controller

  6.Scheduler

### Master V/S Worker node
Master has kube-apiserver installed and nodes have kubelet installed (Kubelet is an agent which make sure nodes are healthy) which provides information to master which stores information in etcd (key value storage)

### Minikube
Minikube is a lightweight Kubernetes implementation that creates a VM on your local machine and deploys a simple cluster containing only one node.

 Download kubectl and minikube to start using minikube
 
### PODS
A Pod is a group of one or more containers, with shared storage and network resources, and a specification for how to run the containers.

### Replication Controllers
Replication Controller used for high availability, it ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any one time. It also helps load balancing and scaling when demand increases.

ReplicaSets replaced replication controllers. A ReplicaSet's purpose is to maintain a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time.

### Basic Commands of K8

1] kubectl get apiservices : List the API Servers

2] kubectl run pod --image=nginx : Create a pod of nginx

3] kubectl get pods : list pods running in namespace

4] kubectl describe pod_name : Describe the pods

5] kubectl get -o wide pod_name : list pods in detailes  

7] kubectl logs pod_name : list out the logs of pods

8] kubectl delete pod <pod_name>: Delete the running pod

9] kubectl cluster-info : gives the information about the cluster

10] kubectl get nodes: list out the nodes

11] kubectl expose pod <pod-name> --type=ClusterIP --port=<port> --target-port=<target-port>: expose a pod on a specific target port

12] kubectl expose pod <pod-name> --type=NodePort --port=<port> --target-port=<target-port>: expose a pod on a specific target port using a ClusterIP

13]kubectl expose pod <pod-name> --type=LoadBalancer --port=<port> --target-port=<target-port>: Create a LoadBalancer type service in Kubernetes

14] kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -c <container-name> -- bash

15] kubectl cp <file-spec-src> <file-spec-dest> :eg. kubectl cp file.txt default/my-pod:/path/to/file.txt

16] kubectl apply -f <filename>: Apply a configuration file to create or update a resource.

17] kubectl get deployments: List all deployments in the current namespace.

18] kubectl get services: List all services in the current namespace.

19] kubectl get namespaces: List all namespaces in the cluster.

20] kubectl scale deployment <deployment-name> --replicas=<replica-count>: Scale a deployment to the specified number of replicas.

21] kubectl rollout status deployment/<deployment-name> :Check the status of a rollout for a deployment.

22] kubectl rollout history deployment/<deployment-name>: View the rollout history for a deployment.

23] kubectl rollout undo deployment/<deployment-name>: Undo the last rollout for a deployment.

24] kubectl delete deployment <deployment-name>: Delete a deployment.

25] kubectl delete service <service-name>: Delete a service.
